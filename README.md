Creating a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves fetching weather data from a weather API, displaying it in your app interface, and styling it with CSS. Here's a basic outline of how you can create one:

1.HTML Structure:
    Create the structure of your weather app using HTML. Include elements for displaying the current weather, such as temperature, description, icon, location, etc.

2.CSS Styling:
    Style your HTML elements using CSS to make the app visually appealing. You can use CSS for layout, fonts, colors, etc.

3.JavaScript for Functionality:
    Use JavaScript to fetch weather data from a weather API. There are several free weather APIs available like OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, etc. Choose one and sign up for an API key.
    Write JavaScript functions to make API requests, handle the response, and update the UI with the weather data.
